<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2026-01-28</p>

<p>
This Privacy Policy applies to all mobile applications developed and published by
<strong>Johan Tobin</strong> ("the developer"), including but not limited to applications such as
<strong>Daily Reflex</strong>.
</p>

<p>
The developer values user privacy and is committed to transparency regarding how data is handled.
This policy explains what information may be collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.
</p>

<h2>1. Information Collection</h2>

<h3>a) Personal Information & User IDs</h3>
<p>
The developer does not require users to provide contact information such as email addresses or phone numbers.
However, to provide specific features such as leaderboards, the app may collect and store:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>User IDs (Firebase UID):</strong> A unique technical identifier used to link a score to a specific user/installation.</li>
    <li><strong>Display Names:</strong> A nickname voluntarily provided by the user for the leaderboard.</li>
</ul>

<h3>b) App Usage and Technical Data</h3>
<p>
To ensure the app functions correctly and to improve stability, the app may collect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Crash Logs:</strong> Data about app crashes to help fix bugs (via Google Crashlytics).</li>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> Performance data such as launch time and latency.</li>
    <li><strong>Device IDs:</strong> Unique identifiers required by Google Firebase and AdMob for security and functionality.</li>
</ul>

<h3>c) Leaderboards</h3>
<p>
Online leaderboards use Google Firebase services. Scores, rankings, and your chosen display name 
are stored in the cloud. This data is necessary for the leaderboard functionality to work across devices.
</p>

<h3>d) Advertising</h3>
<p>
Some apps display advertisements provided by third-party services such as Google AdMob.
These services may automatically collect data to serve relevant ads, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Advertising ID (GAID)</li>
  <li>IP address (approximate location)</li>
  <li>Ad interaction data (views/clicks)</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2>2. Data Deletion (Account Removal)</h2>

<p>
<strong>All users</strong> have the right to request the deletion of their data, including leaderboard scores and User IDs.
</p>

<p>
If you wish to delete your data, please contact the developer at:

<strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jjmtproduction@gmail.com">jjmtproduction@gmail.com</a>

<p>
Please include "Data Deletion Request" in the subject line. We will process your request and remove your 
associated data from our servers within 30 days.

<h2>3. How Information Is Used</h2>

<p>
Information collected is used strictly for:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Managing leaderboards and scores.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> Understanding how the app is used and fixing crashes.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Displaying ads via Google AdMob.</li>
  <li><strong>Security:</strong> Preventing fraud and abuse of the services.</li>
